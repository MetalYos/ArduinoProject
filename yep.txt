Hardware:
EVERYTHING! WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE GETTING OURSELVES INTO!
GRAINS ARE TERRIBLE! LIQUID IS EASY!
WE BROKE A PART
THAT'S WHY THERE'S ONLY 2 BIG CONTAINERS

HALL EFFECT WAS SILLY- WORKED THE OPPOSITE OF EVERY POSSIBLE INSTRUCTION ONLINE.
THE DISPENSERS WERE HARDDDD WE HAD TO MAKE PROTOTYPES AND TOSS THEM IN THE TRASH (ORIGINAL PINK ONE).
AFTER A LOT OF PLANNING AND CALCULATING, AND A HUGE FAVOR FROM A FRIEND, WE FINALLY HAD THE WORKING DISPENSERS.
BUT.
MICRO SERVOS ARE SHIT.

BUILDING THE SCALE IN A BALANCES WAY SO THE READINGS ARE CORRECT.

FINDING THE RIGHT ANGLES FOR EACH SERVO. WE HAVE 5.

I2C- SYNC ISSUES.

Software:
Bluetooth communication.Connecting to the bluetooth module takes a few tries.
Reading from bluetooth sometimes doesn;t work correctly, had to add a lot of buffers.
Creating an icon and images.
Seperating between view and code behind.
Parsing the commands.

Sync scale and servo operations.
Scale sometimes is imbalanced, we need to wait 2 cycles and then reset it before starting the actual weighting.


Things to add:
Vibrations to the containers to help dispense.
Mixer.
Remove Recipe.
More secuirity.
Sharing options.
